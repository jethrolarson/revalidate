Intro
-----
After trying several different validation libraries I was unable to find one that worked well for obtuse validation cases while still having a good UI. I've attempted to create a validation framework that will allow you to write any new strange rules easilly without pain.

Since the goal is to be a framework not a library, validation.coffee doesn't do anything by itself.
app.coffee has some example validation rules and usage, but you may want to adapt that to your application's needs.

This is a new library so please report any bugs you find.

Original source is written in CoffeeScript so I wont merge pull requests that only change the generated js. I may rewrite them in the coffee if I feel like it though.
