You've tried using several different validation libraries. Many were pretty good, full-featured, and easy to use; but somehow you're always running into cases where you need some weird specific validation rule, and hacking these plugins is often really complex and against the grain.

Revalidate is a validation **Framework**. It has been designed to make writing strange validation rules easy while still having great UI.

* **[Demo](examples/index.html)**
* **[Revalidate Framework](docs/validation.html)**
  The validation framework used to create your own validation rules.  
* **[Revalidate Sample Library](docs/validation.lib.html)**
  An example validation library that uses the framework.
* **[UX Specifications](docs/ux-specs.html)**



Example Usage:
--------------

### Set up validation on a form:

    var formValidator = new FormValidator('form');

### Create and attache a validation rule:

    formValidator.addFieldValidator('.requiredTextbox',{
      validator: function() {
        return $.trim(this.value);
      },
      revalidateOn: 'blur keyup',
      message: 'This field is Required'
    });
